    <h2>Spencer Jones</h2>
    <p>As you can tell my name is Spencer Jones. I am married to my wonderful wife and have 4 kids that keep me on my toes. I am a full time student, employee and father/husband. I enjoy my job but I would like to be able to work from home so I can be around my family more. I am planning on becoming certified in divorce mediation. This has the potential to allow me to stay home.</p>
        
    <p>I think that I love the most about BYU-I is the focus on learning through the Savior. I love that the educational experience is something that has such strong gospel connections.</p>
        
    <p>An advantage that I see with this course is I will hopefully be able to design my own website for divorce mediation for when it is needed. I also like to learn about different aspects of life.</p>

    <p>I was born and raised as a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. There have been times that I have strayed from the path, but I am not firmly planted on it and in the right direction.</p>

    <p>I look forward to learning the content and from all of you!</p>
