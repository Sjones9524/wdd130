        <h2>Mediation</h2>
        <p>What is divorce mediation? As a couple, concluding that it would be better off to be divorced instead of together is difficult. Regardless of the circumstances that brought this along it is one of the most financially and emotionally stressful times in someone’s life. Mediation is here to help couples looking to split to achieve the goals that they would like without the monetary cost of lawyers and the time it takes to go through the justice system.</p>
