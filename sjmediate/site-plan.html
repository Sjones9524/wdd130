      <h3>Divorce</h3>
      <p>
        We have all heard that upward of fifty percent of marriages end in divorce. The reasons for this are numerous. Traditionally, one or both parties would obtain a lawyer, who would then make a case and present that case to the courts. This process can be costly and time consuming, the average time for a divorce is twelve months! These are some of the reasons for divorce mediation. Mediated divorces are usually accomplished faster and for less money. Those who are looking for a mediated divorce are looking for a mostly amicable separation without the need for attorneys.

      <h3>Mediation</h3>
      <p>
        What is divorce mediation? As a couple, concluding that it would be better off to be divorced instead of together is difficult. Regardless of the circumstances that brought this along it is one of the most financially and emotionally stressful times in someone’s life. Mediation is here to help couples looking to split to achieve the goals that they would like without the monetary cost of lawyers and the time it takes to go through the justice system. Mediation allows for a mutual separation of martial assets and determine (if applicable) how to effectively coparent. This is not to say that there will not be complications on the way, but as you work with a mediator all the issues and stresses involved with this can be resolved. This process can be difficult, and there needs to be someone there to help couples navigate this with minimal conflict. What is great about mediation is that while the laws surrounding divorce are there because mediation is agreed upon there are certain aspects of divorce that can be amended. Mediation is a great option of those people who are wanting to separate in a more positive manner.
Mediation does not work with ongoing domestic abuse or other behaviors that limit a person’s ability to be honest. If there is any kind of physical or mental abuse, please contact a local authority to get the assistance that is needed.

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        I am a husband and father of 4. I grew up in “typical” family. My parents were married for 30 plus years before my mother passed away. My parents were able to make it through the woes of life. I believe that couples can work through it. There are times that they cannot. I want to guide and help couples as they take on this challenge.
I currently reside in Oregon and can assist in any of you mediation needs via Zoom or in person. For those that are looking to go through the process of mediation I will be happy to help. As a note, our initial contact will be to understand what you and your spouse are wanting to accomplish. This will include setting up a time to meet over Zoom as well as discuss payment options. I cannot provide any legal advice as I am not a lawyer. Mediation is an amicable process. Any initial questions asked is to provide me with the information needed to assist you through this difficult time. No in-depth personal information is required at this time, but because of the nature of mediation it will be required.
Please also note. While I do specialize in divorce I can provide other mediation services. Please inquire about those. Currently if I am needed to mediate in person, I am unable to do so outside of Lake County. When other counties are available, I will post this on this site.
I will not share any personal information with anyone else. This is divorce mediation so regardless of the reason for divorce, I will also need to speak to both parties. Mediation cannot be done with just one party.
