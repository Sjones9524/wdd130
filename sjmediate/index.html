        <h3>✔ One</h3>
        <p>Traditionally, one or both parties would obtain a lawyer, who would then make a case and present that case to the courts. This process can be costly and time consuming; the average time for a divorce is twelve months!</p>
      </div>
      <div class="feature">
        <h3>✔ Two</h3>
        <p>Mediated divorces are usually accomplished faster and for less money.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="feature">
        <h3>✔ Three</h3>
        <p>Those who are looking for a mediated divorce are looking for a mostly amicable separation without the need for attorneys.</p>
