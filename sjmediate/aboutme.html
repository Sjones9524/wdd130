        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a husband and father of 4. I grew up in a “typical” family. My parents were married for 30 plus years before my mother passed away. My parents were able to make it through the worse of life. I believe that couples can work through it. There are times that they cannot. I want to guide and help couples as they take on this challenge.

            I currently reside in Oregon and can assist in any of you mediation needs via Zoom or in person. For those that are looking to go through the process of mediation I will be happy to help. As a note, our initial contact will be to understand what you and your spouse are wanting to accomplish. This will include setting up a time to meet over Zoom as well as discuss payment options. I cannot provide any legal advice as I am not a lawyer. Mediation is an amicable process. Any initial questions asked is to provide me with the information needed to assist you through this difficult time. No in-depth personal information is required at this time, but because of the nature of mediation it will be required.

        Please also note. While I do specialize in divorce I can provide other mediation services. Please inquire about these. Currently if I am needed to mediate in person, I am unable to do so outside of Lake County. When other counties are available, I will post this on this site.
